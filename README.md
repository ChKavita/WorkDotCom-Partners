**Test Data Scripts

You can run data scripts using dx-utils/load_test_data.sh file. 

Data files are in /testdata but there are also some Apex classes in dx-utils/apex-scripts

dx-utils/apex-scripts/deleteTestData.apex can be used to delete that test data and start fresh


**Notes about Test Data

Test data is for following objects
- Location (Core)
- Employee__c (Command Center Package)
-- We will eventually have new scripts for (Core) Employee object but that will be around May 21
